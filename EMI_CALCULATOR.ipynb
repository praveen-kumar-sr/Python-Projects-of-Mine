    "We all have come across the term **`EMI`** in everyday life. While buying any product, we get an option of the **`EMI Payment method`**. The full form of **`EMI`** is **`Equated Monthly Instalment`**. Through this, one must pay a specific sum to the seller on a fixed date each month with a fixed interest rate. EMI calculator helps calculate the amount with its interest rate that a buyer needs to pay to the seller.\n",
    "EMI Calculator is used to calculate home loans, car loans, bike loans, education loans EMI. In this assignment, you make you own EMI Calculator. If you are completely new to the concept of EMIS, then go through this\n",

    "**EMI of a loan have three major factors on which it depends:**\n",
    "article\n",
    "1. **Loan Amount**: This stands for the total amount or the principal amount that the individual has borrowed.\n",
    "2. **Interest Rate**: It is a rate at which the interest is charged on the amount borrowed.\n",
    "3. **Tenure of the Loan**: It is an agreed loan repayment time frame between the borrower and the lender."
